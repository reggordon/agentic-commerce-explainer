# What is Agentic Commerce?

Agentic Commerce (AC) is a new paradigm for digital transactions where autonomous software agents act on behalf of users and businesses to facilitate, optimize, and execute commercial processes.

Instead of users manually searching, comparing, negotiating, and transacting, agentic commerce leverages intelligent agents to:

- **Discover products and services** based on user needs and preferences
- **Negotiate prices and terms** with sellers or other agents
- **Manage shopping carts and orders** for efficiency and accuracy
- **Handle secure payments** and select optimal payment methods
- **Coordinate fulfillment and delivery** with logistics providers

These agents can communicate, collaborate, and make decisions, reducing friction and saving time for all parties. AC enables:

- Personalized shopping experiences
- Automated price optimization
- Seamless checkout and payment
- Transparent order tracking and fulfillment

Ultimately, agentic commerce transforms traditional e-commerce into a smarter, more autonomous, and user-centric process, where software agents do the heavy lifting and users simply set goals or approve outcomes.
